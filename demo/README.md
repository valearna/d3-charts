# node-express-babel-boilerplate
Boilerplate of node.js express app with babel and es6 source code.

#### 1.Clone project

#### 2.Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
#### 3.Run server

```
npm run serve
```
#### 4.Run browser - http://localhost:3000

#### 5.Start work

Start programming in es6 in src directory. Files will be compiled to es5 and served by nodemon server.

#### 6. Important

**Node.js works with ES6 without babel**, so using babel here has sense only with experimentials features which exists in babel and not exists in base node.js, for more info read - https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/.
